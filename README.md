MessageMgr
==========

This Utility allow users to log into a VersionOne account and delete one or more user notification.  Since the core product does not allow a deletion of more than 25 notifications at a time, this will allow users the opportunity to delete all or some other amount of notifications from their inbox.  

Caveat!!  This runs fairly long so I recommend that you take a chunk of a hundred so you can get a feel of how long it takes to process n notifications.  I noticed the rate of 1 per second.
